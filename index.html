<h2>Howdy!</h2>
<p>I'm Ross. By day I work as an indepentent software developer, and recently I've started tutoring in my off hours.</p>

<p>
If you're interested in my Software Development services, you can check out my <a href="/resume.html">Resume</a> and <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ross.mcdonald@pseudoscalar.moe">get in touch</a>, 
I've got more than 15 years experience, worked with dozens of clients
on a wide breadth of topics (including web backends, scientific simulation, embedded, network middleware, games, and more),
and I'd be happy to hear from you.
</p>

<p>
Prior to (and during) my time as a software developer, I studied physics at 
Texas A&amp;M University, earning Bachelors degrees in both math and physics, 
and did all-but-dissertation of a physics PhD with a focus in 
computational physics before life took over.
During grad school, I was a teaching assistant for several graduate and undergraduate courses, 
and also tutored a variety of STEM subjects.
</p>

<p>
After several years in industry I rediscovered my love of teaching and 
yearn to help other understand and engage with what they're learning. 
To that end, I've started live-coding projects on <a target=_"blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/pseudoscalar">Twitch</a>, along with 
occasional streams working through problems in whatever textbook I'm reviewing this week.
BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH! So now I'm also offering formal tutoring services.
</p>

<h2>STEM Tutoring</h2>
<p>
I provide one-on-one tutoring for a wide variety of high school and college level STEM subjects.
Computer science, physics, chemistry, mathematics, if there is a STEM subject you're having trouble finding help for, I can probably help you.
I have a graduate level education in physics with experience as a teaching assistant for both undergraduate and graduate courses.
</p>
<p>
My individual rate is $30/hr, but I can offer a discounted group rate depending on the situation.
If you want in-person help, I live in Bryan and can meetup anywhere in the Bryan/College Station area.
I am also available for online sessions via Zoom.
</p>
<p>
Reach out <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ross.mcdonald@pseudoscalar.moe">by email</a> to schedule a session or if you just have questions.
</p>

<h2>STEM Mentoring</h2>
<p>I offer guidance and mentoring on STEM projects.</p>
<p>
Doing a project is an excellent way of solidifying a student's understaning 
of a topic and combining the knowledge gained from a range of topics. 
It's also just good fun: a chance to make lasting memories and learning 
opportunities. But it can also be frustrating to dive into the unknown, which
is where having an experienced guide comes in handy. Let me help you navigate
your projects!
</p>
<p>
Some example projects, if you'd like inspiration:
<ul>
  <li>Minecraft mods</li>
  <li>WiFi controlled infinity mirror</li>
  <li>Design and Launch of model rockets</li>
  <li>Orbit predictor and visualizer / satelite tracker</li>
  <li>Software Exploits / Whitehat Security</li>
  <li>Chat bot to manage twitch/discord/youtube/etc. channels</li>
</ul>
